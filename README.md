# DnD_search_engine

This program compares a running list of Dungeons and Dungeons heroes!

Files needed to run program: menu.py dnd_interface.py data_base.py

All three of these files must be in the same directory in order for the search engine to function.

Steps for running program:

Create a test database and connect to it from dnd_interface.py and data_base.py files.

Run data_base.py in command line. This will create the table in your test database and populate it with data.

Run dnd_interface.py in command line. This is the user interface portion of the program that allows you to interact with the data.
